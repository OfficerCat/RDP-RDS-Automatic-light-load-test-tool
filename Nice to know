Every user needs Administrator privileges
user.txt needs atleast 2 Usersnames formated like this 

User1
User2
User3

Password for all users should be the same.

For Windows Server 2019 and lower you need to remove internet explorer .. its just too old 
"dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Internet-Explorer-Optional-amd64"

High load leads to long login and logout times, you might see some error messages about being forcefully disconnected by a diffrent client on your RDP Client Machine 
Having a check for high load leads to lower then configured RDP Sessions.

RDP Client host should have atleast 1 Core per 5 Users and 200 MB Ram per Session

Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "HOST" to trust the remote host on both Maschines
